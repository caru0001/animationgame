                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The aim of the game is to help the fabulous Hazel Delight get ready for her Drag Eleganza
                    Extravaganza show. Her
                    look has to be amazing, so you need to help her pick only the best of the best to put together her
                    look.</p>
                <h2>How to play:</h2>
                <p>
                    Pick the high quality items and stay away from bad wigs, crappy makeup and other low quality items.
                    Flats have no place in drag, so you'll also have to stay far away from those. High heels only. The
                    higher the heel and the bigger the wig - the closer you are to God ðŸ™Œ
                    <br>
                    10, 10, 10, 10s across the board! You will have to collect a minimum of 10 high quality items before
                    the time runs
                    out to
                    win as her look has to be no less than a 10/10.
                    <br>
                    If you make too many poor choices her look will be ruined and it's game over.
                    <br>
                    Clicking 3 low quality/bad items results in game over.
                    <br>
                    Getting less than 10 points results in game over.
                </p>
